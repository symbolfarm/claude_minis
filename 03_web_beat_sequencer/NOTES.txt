# Experiment Notes: 03 Music Web App

DATE: 2025-03-16

## Introduction

This experiment is testing the ability of Claude Code to generate a web app with minimal direction. See excerpts from the session below.

## Session Excerpts

> This is an empty project. Can you think of a simple web app idea and try to implement a working demo here? If it isn't too hard, can be it something music related?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to create a simple web app demo in this empty project, preferably music-related. Let me come up with a simple music-related web app idea that I can implement quickly.

  Ideas for a simple music-related web app:
  1. Basic Piano/Keyboard - A virtual piano keyboard that plays notes when keys are clicked
  2. Beat Sequencer - A simple drum machine/beat maker with a grid interface
  3. Music Quiz - A quiz app that tests knowledge of music theory or songs
  4. Music Visualizer - Visualize audio input or predefined music with simple animations
  5. Chord Progression Generator - Generate random chord progressions for songwriting

  I think the simplest to implement with the best visual and interactive results would be the Beat Sequencer. Let's go with that.

  Let me check the current state of the project to see what files exist already:

● Let me create a simple music beat sequencer web app. I'll implement a grid where you can create drum patterns that play in a loop.

...

● I've created a simple beat sequencer web app with the following files:

  1. index.html - The main HTML structure
  2. styles.css - Styling for the sequencer
  3. script.js - JavaScript logic for the beat sequencer
  4. Sample audio files (kick.wav, snare.wav, hihat.wav, clap.wav)
  5. README.md - Documentation

  The app features:
  - A 16-step sequencer grid for 4 different drum sounds
  - Adjustable tempo control (60-200 BPM)
  - Play/stop and clear functionality
  - Synthesized drum sounds using Web Audio API

  To test it, open index.html in a web browser, click on grid cells to create a pattern, and press Play to hear your beat.

% EXPERIMENTER NOTES
% Running the web app at this point showed that it was mostly functional.
% It had problems with the formatting of the app in the web browser.
% It was slightly unexpected that Claude could write working WAV files.
% Most of the WAV files were the same sound, however.
% The next step is to request fixes to the formatting works and sounds.

> Not a bad start. The formatting for the squares is a bit irregular and doesn't line up with the drum sound labels. Please fix this.

● Let me fix the grid formatting issue to properly align the squares with the labels.

...

● I've fixed the grid layout by:

  1. Modifying the CSS:
    - Set the grid to use explicit columns with a fixed 100px width for labels
    - Added consistent height to cells (40px) and row labels
    - Increased the gap between cells for better spacing
    - Made sure cells have consistent width
  2. Simplifying the JavaScript grid creation:
    - Removed the separate label column structure
    - Added labels and cells directly to the grid in the proper order
    - Maintained the row/beat relationships for playback

  The grid should now display properly with labels aligned with their corresponding rows of beat cells, creating a cleaner and more organized interface.

> Nearly got it. The squares are all the same size and the drum sound labels line up, but the rows of squares for each sequence extend outside the box that looks like it should contain them.

● Let me fix the container width issue to ensure all squares fit properly within the container.

...

● I've made several adjustments to fix the grid layout:

  1. Increased the container width to 1000px to accommodate all cells and added overflow-x: hidden to prevent horizontal scrolling.
  2. Improved the grid cell sizing:
    - Set a max-width of 36px on cells to maintain consistent size
    - Reduced cell height to 36px for a more compact grid
    - Used minmax(30px, 1fr) for the grid columns to control minimum and maximum width
    - Reduced the gap between cells to 6px for better spacing
  3. Adjusted row labels to match the new cell height for perfect alignment.

  These changes should ensure that all the beat sequencer cells fit neatly within the container while maintaining proper alignment with the drum sound labels.

> Great! Last request for this demo. Can you have a go at making the clap sound more "clappy"? It is pretty similar to the hi-hat right now.

● Let me improve the clap sound to make it more distinctive from the hi-hat:

...

● I've completely redesigned the clap sound to make it more realistic and distinctive from the hi-hat. Here's what I improved:

  1. Created a multi-layered clap sound with these key characteristics:
    - Multiple impulses with slight timing differences (0-12ms apart) to simulate several hands clapping
    - Sharper attack with a distinctive mid-frequency focus
    - Added a bandpass filter effect to focus energy in mid frequencies (around 300Hz)
    - Included a longer reverb tail to give it spatial dimension
  2. Technical improvements:
    - Increased buffer size for longer reverb tail
    - Added soft clipping to prevent distortion
    - Created a more sophisticated synthesis approach using multiple noise bursts

  The new clap sound should have:
  - A more "slappy" initial transient
  - The characteristic "spread" of multiple hands clapping slightly out of sync
  - A roomier sound with reverb
  - Less high-frequency content than the hi-hat, focusing more on mid frequencies

  This should make the clap sound much more distinguishable from the hi-hat in your beat patterns.

> I probably wasn't clear. The clap now sounds more like I would expect for a cymbal. The snare also has a strong white-noise sound to it. Can you make the clap more like a single-person clap with fast attack and decay? Can you try to clean up 
  the white noise on the snare too?

● Let me fix both the clap and snare sounds to match your expectations:

...

● I've completely revised both the snare and clap sounds based on your feedback:

  1. Clap Sound (Single-Person Clap):
    - Redesigned as a short, sharp single hand clap with very fast attack and decay
    - Added an initial sharp transient for the characteristic "slap" sound
    - Reduced the noise component significantly
    - Used a mid-range frequency (800Hz) to get the "palm hitting palm" character
    - Made it much shorter (cutting off after 5000 samples)
    - Implemented a two-stage envelope with extremely fast attack (1ms) and quick decay
  2. Snare Drum Sound:
    - Added a drum body component using a sine wave at 180Hz for a more defined tone
    - Reduced the white noise component by 70% (from 0.8 amplitude to 0.3)
    - Made the noise decay faster (increased decay rate from -5 to -15)
    - Combined the tonal and noise components for a more balanced snare sound

  The snare should now have a more defined "drum" character with less white noise, and the clap should sound like a quick, sharp single-person hand clap with almost no sustain - just the initial "slap" sound.
